# List the things you added for points
"Include more than eight knots" - Knots on lines 38, 46, 85, 132, 164, 215, 284, 300, and 327.
"Create at least one major choice that the player can make. A major choice is something that changes the ending of the story." - In the =whatisit knot on line 340, the player makes a choice that sends them on one of two different endings. (Really, it's one of four, depending on the mood stat found earlier in the game, but there are two options there to pick from.)\\ 

"Include at least one loop" - All branches from the == stars == knot loop back to it (stars knot at line 46, looped back to at lines 82, 107, 130, 151, 157, 162, 189, 209, 239, 276, 281, 298, and 311.\\

"Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item" - I don't really have concrete "items," but I have a lot of places where an earlier choice wll be referenced in later dialogue. One example of this is in the ==constellation== knot, where the player asks their friend about a constellation. Until it can't be seen in the night sky anymore, each loop back to the ==stars== loop references the constellation the player chose. (Choice on line 87, referenced on line 63.)\\

"Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)" - I added a "mood" stat to the game which represents how the player's friend (who they talk to throughout the entire game) is feeling. This creates slightly different dialogue, alters which endings are available to the player, and gives the player an additional dialogue option. (A few instances of mood changes on lines 125, 159, and 177. A reference to it on lines 61 and 63. A dialogue option locked behind the mood stat on line 77. Mood affects the endings on lines 351 and 381.)\\

"Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)." I don't know if this counts, but I tried to make the ==stars== knot show different dialogue every time it's visited by varying what it displays based on the time of night in the game's story. (This can be found starting on line 50!)
